# What is React?
* **ReactJS** is a **JavaScript** library or framework that is used to create and manage **user interfaces**.
* Although there is a significant difference between a library and a framework, Geeks can not determine whether **ReactJS** is a library or a framework.
    * A **library** is a set of classes that contains useful methods which **you call** to do specific jobs.
    * A **framework** is a code skeleton that defines the architecture of an application and **it calls** your code to specify certain things in the application.
* A web page is composed of a set of **components** such as header, footer, sidebar, etc. **React** builds and reuses these components to create the **user interfaces** and change them dynamically throughout their life-cycle and in response to user actions.
* If you are familiar with **MVC** architecture pattern you can consider **React** as the **V**(**View**) of that pattern.
