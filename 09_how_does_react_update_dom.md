# How does ReactJS Update the DOM?
* The process of **rendering and rerendering the DOM** is really slow. For that reason it would significantly enhance the performance if we could **rerender** only the element that has been changed and keep the unchanged elements of the DOM as it is without rerendering.
* **ReactJS** has a really smart solution for this problem. **ReactJS** represents the DOM in JavaScript(what is called **worktul DOM**) which can be processed very fast and whenever the state changes, **ReactJS** compares the new worktul DOM after the state change with the old worktul DOM and determines the differences based on this comparison and then rerender only the element that has been changed.
* We can check that on the browser. In **Chrome** or **Chromium** hit ` options -> More tools -> Rendering ` and then enable ` Paint fetching `. The browser will highlight the elements that are rerendered when you interact with it. In our last example: on hitting the button ` Increment ` only the div wrapping the ` count ` value is what gets rerendered.
